# Chapter 0 - Introduction

## The Golden Rule

                         Multi-tasking does not exist.

You can study only one thing at a time, so close the browser tabs that are not related to the study topic, remove all the books that are not relevant, and **focus completely and exclusively on that task**. This is the only way of making effective use of time. Everything else is time-wasting.

## General Strategy

We want to find a learning strategy that is at the same effective and efficient. We don't want to go around in circles, nor repeat the same thing over and over again. For these purpose we need:

1. Clear understanding and memory techniques.
2. Spaced repetition.
3. Hands-on practice. A lot of it.

- Skim through the chapter. What are the individual sections about?
- Read the whole chapter once, looking into the notebook to make sure that theory and code are matching. Don't write code yet. Just get the gist of the topic.
- At the end of a section, stop and repeat in your head. Can you identify parts that you haven't understood?
- Now implement variations of what you have read in a notebook. It doesn't have to be pretty, it's just a learning sandbox. Identify the weak spots and the possible extensions.
